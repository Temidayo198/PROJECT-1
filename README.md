# PROJECT-1
This project analyzes sales data for a retail store, aiming to uncover valuable insights into product performance, regional sales trends, and monthly sales fluctuations. Using Excel for initial data exploration and pivot table analysis, this project calculates key metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region. SQL is then used to query the dataset, revealing insights like top-selling products, total sales by product category, and sales distribution across regions. Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes these findings, providing a comprehensive view of the retail store's sales performance.
